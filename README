README
======

This repository contains the meta-data used to convert the Scribus SVN
(svn://scribus.net) repository to Git.

The trunk and all branches and tags are imported from SVN into Git.

The SVN repository contains an additional folder "Scribus" at the
project root. This folder is skipped during conversion, so that the
programm sources appear in the repository root.

All SVN commiters need to listed in svn_authors.txt.

The git_repo_init.sh script configures an empty Git repository to
receive the SVN commits.

The update_from_svn.sh script pulls new commits from SVN, creates Git
tags from SVN tags and pushes the result to the configured "origin"
Git remote repository.
